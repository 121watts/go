## Getting Help

- **Step 1:** Use [play.golang.org](http://play.golang.org) to create an example of your problem (make sure it runs if it's supposed to).
- **Step 2:** Post on one of the communities listed above.
- **Step 3:** State your problem clearly, and link to the example on the go playground you created in step 1.
- Be respectful.  Most people have a willingness to help and will do so.
- Remember, help doesn't mean writing the code for you, it means pointing you in the right direction to solve the problem yourself.

If all else fails, you can use twitter to reach out to us.
